 * \brief The SerialPort base class.
 *
 * This class provide abstraction to use the serial port across Linux, Windows
 * and macOS operating systems. Almost all of this code is heavily OS dependent,
 * and therefore most functions are only implemented in child classes.
 *
 * Both Dynamixel and HerkuleX devices are using the same settings:
 * - Data Bit: 8
 * - Stop Bit: 1
 * - No parity
 * - No flow control
 *
 * We support baudrate values from:
 * - 9.6k to 10.5M for Dynamixels.
 * - 57.6k to 1M for HerkuleX.
 *
 * Note: we will assume 1 baud = 1 bit when using modern UART implementations
 * and TTL converters which only transfer one symbole at a time.
 * More details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_bit_rate#Gross_bit_rate
