Design is tight, if the 3D printer is not precise in all axis,  3D print has to be amended manually. So, each leg needs to be assembled without wiring first to check if all parts fit together.
Before assembling, put all servos to a null position with Herkulex Servo Manager.

**Preparation**

* put bushing in ball bearing 35x44x5

* put inner bushing into outer bushing to put pressure to the connection between ball bearing and bushing

* screw down small gearwheel and ball bearing 11x7x3 onto DRS-0101 Servo

** Assembly**

* Start with Foot, put sensor PCB and distance sensor at the dedicated positions

* Put the disk that holds the silicone dampener in the foot

* Insert  the distance sleeve that keeps both halves together

* Turn the foot, watch  the hole that carries the bearing later on. Very likely, the wires can be seen

* Carefully put the wires aside, pushing them to the left and right of the bearing hole

* Screw down whole foot
<img width=300 src="../images/foot-done.jpg.jpg"/> 


* down the DRS-0201 servo with the disk side  into one half
* put 200mm cable into servo, lay wires to the hole in the fixed half, and put the second half on top of it. Carefully put the wires out of the bearing hole
* Put bearing into bearing hole
* screw down foot

* Continue with knee half that takes the gearwheel. Put wire from foot into wire tunnel, put into DRS-101 servo.
* connect 300mm wire to serve. Put it into cable cannel
* screw down 3 distance sleeve into that knee-half
* put bushing into rabbet such that the wire tunnel in the big gearwheel is on the bottom side of the knee/foot
* screw down the other half of the knee
