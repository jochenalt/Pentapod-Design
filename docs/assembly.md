It's a good idea to assemble each leg without wiring upfront to check if all parts fit together. If not, file until it does.

Before assembling, put all servos to a null position and assign their identifier to it according to the convention as stated in the [Herkulex ID convention](http://poor-pentapod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bill-of-material/#herkulex-ids) with the [Herkulex Servo Manager](http://poor-pentapod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bill-of-material/#tools)

**Preparation**

Put bushing in ball bearing 35x44x5

Put inner bushing into outer bushing to apply pressure to the connection between ball bearing and bushing

Screw down small gearwheel and ball bearing 11x7x3 onto DRS-0101 Servo, that is intended for turning the knee.

** Assembly**

Start with the foot, put the sensor PCB and distance sensor at the dedicated positions

Put the disk that holds the silicone dampener in the foot

Insert the hexagonal bolt that keeps both halves together

Turn the foot and have a look at the hole that carries the bearing later on. Very likely, the wires can be seen where the bearing is supposed to be later on.

Carefully put the wires aside, pushing them to the left and to the right of the bearing hole and put the 11x7x3 ball bearing in the hole

Screw down whole foot

Now put the bushing with the bearing and the big bevel gear into one half of the thigh. Take care that the small rabbet of the bevel gear is located as on the picture (this rabbet is for the wire)

Put the DRS-0101 servo we prepared upfront into its target position. Take a 300mm servo wire, put it into the servos socket and draw the wrire carefully through the hole in the bearing and the rabbet of the bevel gear.

Turn the knee and screw the foot to the knee

Turn the knee , put the three hexagonal bolts in the knee and assembly the other half of the knee. Screw it down.

* put bushing into rabbet such that the wire tunnel in the big gearwheel is on the bottom side of the knee/foot
* screw down the other half of the knee
