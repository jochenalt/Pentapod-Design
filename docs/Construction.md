My first trial was a construction with 7 legs which I simulated on my laptop only.

But 7 legs is really a lot, and would not be cheap either.
When I came up with the idea of not adding but removing a leg, I had in mind a design with very thin leg with 5 thigh gaps, and no wires crossing the joints. The servo motors should be hidden, and should not lead to ugly bulges as a consequence of the cuboid shape of a servo, which makes it difficult to have an axial movement.

I startet with this construction which I liked very much, it is very lean and creepy:

Standing up was difficult, but worked finally:

walking was possible as well

and even twerking

Unfortunately, it turned out that once I put in batteries and the lidar on top, it gained 500 gramms of weight and the servo in the thigh was not strong enough to lift and move the body anymore.
It had a breakdown every here and then, and the body crashed on the ground since the servos activated the emergency shutdown. So, I intended tro use a stronger servo in the thigh, and had to design the leg like this:

The hip consists of 
The mechanical construction of the body is rather easy, a round thing with a hole on top and 5 planes to mount the legs
